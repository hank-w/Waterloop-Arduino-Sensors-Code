# Waterloop-Arduino-Sensors-Code

This folder contains the code used to program the accelerometer, digital temperature sensor, magnetometer, and IR line sensor. The sensors are mounted on our DLIM (Dual Linear Induction Motor) chassis and are used to measure and experiment with the changes for the motor, the current and voltage supplied into it, the magnetic field induced by the current through coil windings, and the effects of the structural components of the chassis on the DLIM.
